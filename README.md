# Student-Affairs-Website

This project has been exclusively crafted for the sole purpose of serving administrative functions and is intentionally kept out of reach for students. Within the Student Affairs module, there are pivotal goals that encompass a range of actions, including the addition of students, the refinement of student data, the removal of student records, as well as the creation of an exhaustive list comprising actively enrolled students, which extends over a span of 12 pages.
